/**
 * Problem 200. Number of Islands
 *
 * Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land)
 * and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
 *
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands
 * horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are
 * all surrounded by water.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input:
 *     [ ['1','1','1','1','0'],
 *       ['1','1','0','1','0'],
 *       ['1','1','0','0','0'],
 *       ['0','0','0','0','0'] ]
 *   Output: 1
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input:
 *     [ ['1','1','0','0','0'],
 *       ['1','1','0','0','0'],
 *       ['0','0','1','0','0'],
 *       ['0','0','0','1','1'] ]
 *   Output: 3
 *
 * Intuition:
 *   The grid defines an undirected graph where each '1' cell is a vertex
 *   connected to its up/down/left/right neighbors that are also '1'. Each
 *   island is one connected component.
 *
 * Approach:
 *   - Use DFS/BFS to count connected components of '1's.
 *   - Maintain a visited mark by flipping '1'â†’'0' when we visit it.
 *   - Iterate over every cell; when we find a '1', increment count and
 *     perform DFS from that cell to mark the entire island as '0'.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(m * n), since each cell is visited at most once.
 * Space Complexity: O(m * n) in the worst case recursion depth (all land).
