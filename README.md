THE DSA PROJECT

Status: In Progress still working on it.

A work-in-progress collection of data structures and algorithms implemented primarily in C++ and Java. This repository serves as a learning tool and reference for understanding core computer science concepts.


Introduction

THE DSA PROJECT is a developing repository dedicated to implementing and experimenting with various data structures and algorithms. The aim is to provide clear, well-documented code samples in C++ and Java. Although the project is not yet complete, contributions and feedback are welcome as it grows and evolves.

Current Status

Work In Progress: Many components are still under development.

Incomplete Modules: Not all data structures or algorithm topics have been fully implemented.

Active Development: New code and improvements are expected as the project evolves.


Technologies

This project mainly utilizes:

- C++: For performance-oriented implementations of data structures and algorithms.
- Java: For object-oriented implementations and additional algorithm practice.
- Git & GitHub: For version control and collaboration.

Note: At this moment, there is no requirements.txt because the project is not using a package manager for Python libraries.


Installation & Setup

Since the project is primarily in C++ and Java, follow the steps below to get started:


For C++:
- Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/KeerthanaTurai/THE-DSA-PROJECT.git
- Navigate to the Project Directory: cd THE-DSA-PROJECT
- Compile a C++ File:
  - g++ -o example examples/cpp/example.cpp
  - ./example
For Java:
- Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/KeerthanaTurai/THE-DSA-PROJECT.git
- Navigate to the Java Project Directory: cd THE-DSA-PROJECT/java_examples
- Compile and Run a Java Program:
  Assuming you are inside a folder with your Java files, run:
  - javac Example.java
  - java Example
Tip: Adjust paths as necessary based on where your examples or modules are stored.


Usage
